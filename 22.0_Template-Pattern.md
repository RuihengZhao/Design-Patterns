# Template Pattern

An abstract class exposes defined way(s)/template(s) to execute its methods. Its subclasses can override the method implementation as per need but the invocation is to be in the same way as defined by an abstract class.

```
public abstract class Game {
    abstract void initialize();
    abstract void startPlay();
    abstract void endPlay();

    public final void play() {
        initialize();
        startPlay();
        endPlay();
    }
}

public class Cricket extends Game {
    @Override
    void initialize() {
        System.out.println("Cricket Game Initialized! Start playing.");
    }

    @Override
    void startPlay() {
        System.out.println("Cricket Game Started. Enjoy the game!");
    }

    @Override
    void endPlay() {
        System.out.println("Cricket Game Finished!");
    }
}

public class TemplatePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Game game = new Circket();
        game.play();
    }
}
```
