# Design Patterns

Goal:
- understand problema and matching it with pattern
- reusage of old interface or making present design reusable for future

Types:
- Creational: class instantiation or object creation. (Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool and Prototype)

- Structural: organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data and Proxy)

- Behavioral: identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. (Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor)
