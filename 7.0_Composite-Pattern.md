# Composite Pattern

Treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as while hieracrchy.

```
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private String dept;
    private int salary;
    private List<Employee> subordinates;

    public Employee(String name, String dept, int sal) {
        this.name = name;
        this.dept = dept;
        this.salary = sal;
        subordinates = new ArrayList<Employee>();
    }

    public void add(Employee e) {
        subordinates.add(e);
    }

    public void remove(Employee e) {
        subordinates.remove(e);
    }

    public List<Employee> getSubordinates(){
        return subordinates;
    }
}

public class CompositePatternDemo {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Employee CEO = new Employee("John","CEO", 30000);
       Employee headSales = new Employee("Robert","Head Sales", 20000);
       Employee headMarketing = new Employee("Michel","Head Marketing", 20000);
       
       CEO.add(headSales);
       CEO.add(headMarketing);
